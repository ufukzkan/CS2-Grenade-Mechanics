In this project, I created the bomb throwing mechanics of the CS2 (formerly CS:GO) game. You can switch between animations using Blend Tree with the specified float value. Left click, right click, both right and left click are sent to different distances. The float value, which receives input value according to the mouse button we press, sets the animation to be played in blend tree and the distance to be sent.
